# Image to Painting

### Image to Painting is an implementation of the Cycle-Gan Generative Deep Learning Model.<br />
The project was created initially to solve the [Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started) competition, the chalange was to create a model that gets a normal image and converts it to a Monet painting style image.

In competition it was allowed to use up to 300 paintings for the training phase but as an extra step i chose to train the model only using 30 monets.<br />

You can try the model yourself!<br />
Steps<br />
* clone or download the project
* on the terminal run: **python3 app.py**

This would create a web server where you can upload an image and see the result.<br />
To see the whole implemintation of the project you can look up the [Cycle-Gan Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IyRGZno5u_RpRvM7lnzgKz_Fqm_OfBD4/view?usp=share_link)
